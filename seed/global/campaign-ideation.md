## Campaign Ideation Process (6 Steps)

### Step 1: Analyze ICP Matrix
- Check the ICP matrix the client filled in during onboarding
- Prioritize industries where they have traction or clear product-market fit
- Don't invent personas — start with what's already working

### Step 2: Identify Similar Clients
- Use enrichment tools to find patterns among existing customers
- Examine: Industry, company size, region, technology stack, funding stage
- The goal is to find 10-50 lookalike prospects to validate before scaling

### Step 3: Determine Trigger Events
Relevant situational triggers that prompt buyer action:
- Headcount expansion (hiring for specific roles)
- Fundraising rounds (Series A, B, seed)
- New software implementations (BuiltWith data)
- Active job openings (signals team growth or specific pain)
- Merger or acquisition activity
- Regulatory shifts in their industry
- Role changes (new VP, new CRO)
- New office opening or geographic expansion
- Negative Glassdoor reviews (signals churn, cultural issues)
- Competitor bad reviews (signals frustration with alternatives)

### Step 4: Review Current Campaign Performance
- What are current campaigns saying that's getting replies?
- Which industries are replying the most?
- What angles have been tested and failed?
- What CTAs are driving responses?

### Step 5: Validate Segment Size
- Verify that target segments contain 500-1,000+ accounts for scalability
- Sub-500 accounts are niche plays — viable but need higher personalization
- Use Apollo, Clay, or similar to count available leads before building

### Step 6: Stakeholder Alignment
- Run a quick Loom, Slack summary, or live call walkthrough
- Present findings to client before execution
- Get buy-in on ICP, offer angle, and trigger before building lists

**Core Principle**: Balance creative thinking with data-driven insights. Don't purely assume and don't overcomplicate.

## GTM Plays (Outbound Strategies)

### Play 1: New Team Members
Outreach targeting recently hired staff at relevant departments. Personalize with their name and the fact that they're new.
- Best for: Any industry where onboarding matters
- Timing signal: LinkedIn "Started new role" notification, <3 months in role

### Play 2: Skills-Targeting
Identify prospects through specific LinkedIn skills displayed on their profile.
- Best for: Technical roles, specialized functions
- Signal: Specific skill listed = they're responsible for that function

### Play 3: Role-Targeting
Focus on individuals with specialized job titles as indicators of organizational priorities.
- Best for: Any vertical
- Example: Title contains "Head of Growth" → growth is a priority

### Play 4: Industry-Level Research Offer
Conduct surveys or compile research reports with your ICP as the audience. Offer the results as a lead magnet.
- Best for: Agencies, consultancies
- Positions you as industry expert, not just another vendor

### Play 5: Resources for Individual Contributors
Provide genuinely helpful materials to newly-hired entry-level employees who will champion you internally.
- Best for: SaaS, tools, training
- Bottom-up sales motion

### Play 6: Companies Without Dedicated Staff
Target organizations lacking specific departmental personnel (no SDRs, no dedicated [function]).
- Best for: Service providers who fill that gap
- Signal: Company size + no [function] team member on LinkedIn

### Play 7: Bad Reviews Targeting
Reach out to people who posted negative reviews of a competitor on G2 or Glassdoor.
- Best for: Direct competitor displacement
- High intent — they're actively frustrated with current solution

### Play 8: TikTok Shop / New Platform Opportunity
Target brands that have a presence on one platform but haven't expanded to another.
- Example: Has TikTok account but no TikTok Shop
- Best for: E-commerce service providers

### Play 9: Inbound Followers
Reach out to people who follow your company or engage with your content but haven't converted.
- Best for: Companies with existing content/audience
- Warm signal — they already know you exist

### Play 10: Name-Dropping a Colleague
Reference a specific team member at the company in your personalization to trigger internal forwarding.
- Limit to 3 people per company maximum
- Creates internal dialogue; increases forwards to the right person
