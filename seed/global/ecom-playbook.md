## Current E-Commerce Landscape

E-commerce decision-makers receive 100+ cold emails daily. They are extremely jaded by:
- Overhyped case studies about ROAS improvements
- Generic Klaviyo audit pitches
- Repetitive "we increase email revenue" messaging
- Any agency pitch that leads with credentials over value

Traditional pitches have lost effectiveness through overuse. The market has shifted.

## Core Strategy: Value-First Offers

Rather than generic pitches, provide tangible work upfront before asking for money:
- Free welcome flow creation
- Complimentary ad creative development
- Checkout page mock-ups
- CRO audits with visual documentation

**Why this works**: Gives value before money is discussed. Requires minimal recipient commitment. Proves capability without asking for trust first.

## Current High-Opportunity Angles

1. **TikTok Shop optimization** — still emerging, low competition in email pitching
2. **Influencer-driven creative development** — UGC and creator content is exploding
3. **Micro-UGC bundles** — affordable creative at scale
4. **Checkout conversion improvements** — measurable, high-ROI
5. **Post-purchase flow optimization** — often neglected by brands

## Prospecting Approach

**Data sources**: Apollo, Clay, or Shopify/Klaviyo scrapers
**Filters to use**:
- Industry keywords: apparel, beauty, supplements, home goods, pet products
- Technology filters: Shopify, Klaviyo, WooCommerce
- Revenue signals: Estimated $50k-$5M/month GMV (above "startup" tier)

**Volume**: Lead pools of 10,000-50,000 records available in most niches

## Message Framework for E-Com

- Keep messages 15-30 words maximum in the first touch
- Emphasize the specific offer over agency credentials
- Lead with what you're giving them, not who you are
- No case studies in Email 1 — they've seen them all and don't trust them

**What NOT to say**:
- "We help e-commerce brands increase revenue by X%"
- "We've worked with [Big Brand] and achieved [result]"
- "Our Klaviyo audit would be perfect for you"

**What DOES work**:
- "I built a free welcome flow for [Company] — want it?"
- "Made a quick mock-up of a checkout change that could lift conversions — want to see?"
- "Spotted something on your TikTok — have a hook idea that's been crushing for similar brands, mind if I share?"

## Email Example (E-Com)

```
Subject: Quick idea for [Brand]

[Name] —

I checked out [Brand]'s site this morning and put together a quick checkout page mock-up.

Think it could bump conversions by [realistic range]%.

Worth a look?

P.S. No strings — just thought it was a fun test to run.
```

## Core Principle

Success in e-commerce outbound comes from being more relevant and delivering more value upfront — not from sending more emails or showing bigger case studies.

The brand already has agencies pitching them. You need to show, not tell.
