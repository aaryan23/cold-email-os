## What Is a Pattern Breaker?

A pattern breaker is an intentional break from predictable, templated cold email norms. It forces the recipient to pause, process, and engage — because it stands out.

Predictability is the enemy in cold email. Prospects receive hundreds of sales emails weekly. Most look, sound, and feel the same.

Common techniques: curiosity, cognitive dissonance, humor, and unconventional formatting.

**Important**: These should supplement — not replace — a solid, structured core campaign. Use them to A/B test and keep outreach fresh.

## Patterns to ELIMINATE from Your Emails

1. Starting every email with "Hi {{FirstName}}," — try alternatives
2. Company credentials upfront ("We're the #1 provider of X") — weave credentials into P.S. instead
3. Irrelevant big brand name drops in social proof — only relevant case studies build trust
4. Cheesy icebreakers and forced jokes that don't transition smoothly
5. GIFs that aren't personalized — "sad puppy GIFs" are now cliché
6. Excessive formality ("Dear Sir/Madam" / "I hope this email finds you well")
7. Lazy personalization ("Really loved your last blog post!" with no detail)
8. "Just club" phrases: "Just checking in," "Just following up," "Just circling back"
9. Day greeting filler: "Happy Monday!" / "Hope you had a great weekend!"
10. Empty LinkedIn intros: "My CEO suggested I reach out…"

## The 34 Pattern Disruptors

1. **Decapitalize the first name** — "penn" instead of "Penn" — feels casual, non-corporate, like a colleague messaging
2. **Decapitalize the job title** — "founder" instead of "Founder" — strips formality
3. **Casualize the job title** — "Founder" → "head man" — adds human touch
4. **Subtle misspelled word** — "StackOptimize" instead of "StackOptimise" — triggers subconscious pause, forces engagement
5. **Use brackets in text** — creates informality, off-the-cuff side-note feel
6. **One-sentence emails** — forces brevity and confidence, impossible to ignore
7. **One-sentence paragraphs** — improves readability, mimics natural speech
8. **Reference a colleague** — "Might this be more suitable for Simon, your HoS?" — creates internal dialogue, increases forwards
9. **Voice notes on LinkedIn** — still grossly underused, feels personal and harder to ignore
10. **Video messages via Loom/Sendspark** — adds a face to outreach, builds trust
11. **Slang or mild swear words** — "Guarantee you a sh*t ton of meetings" — real, confident, stands out from corporate-speak
12. **"Picture this…" scenario framing** — helps them visualize success, makes it feel tangible
13. **Reference competitors** — instantly relevant, drives FOMO and curiosity
14. **Unapologetically vulnerable** — "I honestly just really wanna work with you guys" — humanizes, disarms skepticism
15. **Numbered lists or bullet points** — improves scannability, digestible in seconds
16. **Comparative metaphor** — "It's as seamless as your payment feature" — aligns offer with something they already trust
17. **Specificity around timing** — "This morning," — creates urgency and immediacy
18. **Curiosity opener** — "Penn, brace yourself" or "Penn, got something for you…" — forces them to read on
19. **Curiosity statement** — "Got a strategy for you — it's likely not what you think it is" — sparks intrigue
20. **Curiosity adjectives** — "wacky," "wild," "bonkers" — signals something unconventional
21. **Hedge against inaccurate data** — "I see you have 15 employees (LinkedIn data, grain of salt!)" — acknowledges errors, builds credibility
22. **Proactive disqualification** — "Saw the SDR job ad — assuming then you're probably not looking for…" — reverses typical sales approach, reduces resistance
23. **P.S. statements** — one of the most-read parts of any email — perfect for social proof, humor, or soft CTA
24. **No CTA** — "When the time's right, I'd love to be your next dance partner" — creates intrigue while removing pressure
25. **Condense email body, load social proof in P.S.** — keeps main message lean
26. **Humanize the company name** — if 3+ words, make it an acronym — more approachable
27. **ABC CTAs** — "John, choose your adventure: Reply A for this, B for this, or C for this" — gamifies the response
28. **Humbling disclaimers** — "Shot in the dark, but here goes" / "On the off chance you actually open this" — lowers defenses
29. **"This email was 95% written by a human."** — humor, taps into AI curiosity
30. **Wild claim before salutation** — fake legal disclaimer, bold statement, or cheeky opener above the "Hi [Name]"
31. **Share industry insight in the email** — positions you as expert, not just another seller
32. **"{Company} x {Competitor}" in subject line** — creates intrigue, increases open rates
33. **Quote from case study as the entire email** — great for follow-ups, drives social proof
34. **Poke-the-bear question in subject line, email body directs back to subject line** — triggers curiosity through unique formatting

## Opening Line Alternatives to "Hi {{FirstName}},"

- Lead with the opening hook, add name in the CTA
- "VP for one of the hottest MarTecks, 3 months into the role — smooth start Dan?"
- "This email will take exactly 9.3 seconds to read."
- Start with addressing a specific observation, skip pleasantries entirely

## When to Use Pattern Breakers

- A/B test against your control sequence — don't replace your whole campaign
- Strategies get saturated fast; rotate and refresh regularly
- Never sacrifice clarity for cleverness — the prospect still needs to understand your offer
