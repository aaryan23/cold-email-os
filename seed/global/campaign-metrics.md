## Core Email Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Benchmarks |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Reply Rate | Replies / Leads Contacted | 2-4% cold outbound, 6-8% excellent, 18-22% signal-based |
| Positive Reply Rate | Positive replies / All replies | 40-65% healthy; below 33% = rework targeting/copy |
| Leads per Positive Reply | **North star metric** | <100 = high performance, ~200 = decent, 300-375 = average |
| Bounce Rate | Bounced / Sent | <2% healthy; >5% = stop and fix list quality |

## Critical Thresholds

- **700-1,000 emails sent without a single positive reply** = pause the campaign immediately and rework copy/targeting
- **Email 1 generates ~58-80% of all positive replies** — the first email is the most important
- **First follow-up alone can increase reply rate by 49%**

## Follow-Up Sequence Performance Data

| Email # | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Email 1 | Baseline ~3% reply rate |
| Email 2 | +60% boost (4.8%) |
| Email 3 | +21% further boost (5.8%) |
| Email 4 | DROPS by 20% |
| Email 5 | DROPS by another 55% |

**Conclusion**: Stop at 3 emails. Additional follow-ups increase spam complaints and hurt deliverability.

## LinkedIn Metrics

| Metric | Benchmarks |
|--------|-----------|
| Acceptance Rate | 40%+ excellent, 30-40% good, <25% needs work |
| Reply Rate | 10-17% typical |
| Leads per Positive Reply | Target ≤300-375 |

LinkedIn DMs: ~21% average reply rate vs cold email ~4% — higher quality engagement, lower volume.

## List Size vs. Performance

| List Size | Average Reply Rate |
|-----------|-------------------|
| <50 people | 5.8% |
| >1,000 people | <2% |

Smaller, targeted lists perform nearly 3× better. Run multiple targeted campaigns instead of one massive campaign.

## 2026 Sending Limits (Safety Standards)

- **Maximum**: 30 emails per day per inbox (conservative)
- **Careful maximum**: 50 emails per day per inbox
- **Old dangerous standard** (2022): 200/day — now ruins reputation

## Performance Benchmarks Table

| Metric | Cold Email | LinkedIn |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Reply Rate | 3-8% cold; 18-22% signal | 10-17% |
| Positive Reply % | 40-65% | 40-65% |
| Leads per Positive | <375 avg; <200 good | <375 avg |
| Bounce Rate | <2% healthy; >5% stop | N/A |
| Acceptance Rate | N/A | 30-45% |

## Client Reporting North Stars

Clients don't care about open rates. They care about:
1. Positive replies
2. Meetings booked
3. Emails sent
4. Active campaigns status

Reporting schedule: Internal — at least twice weekly. Client syncs — weekly.

Always emphasize trajectory over static percentages. Guide decisions with data-driven insights.

## Campaign Iteration Triggers

- Below 33% positive reply rate from all replies → rework targeting
- >5% bounce rate → fix list quality, verify emails before sending
- 700-1,000 emails no positives → pause, rework copy AND targeting
- Reply rate dropping after follow-up 3 → reduce follow-up sequence length
