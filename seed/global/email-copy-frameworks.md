## Core Email Writing Rules

- Keep emails under 100 words
- Focus more on the prospect than yourself
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Solve actual prospect problems
- Be hyper-relevant — reference specific triggers
- Make the offer strategic, not generic
- Deliver value before asking for anything

Subject lines: 1-3 words only, topic-focused.

## Essential Email Components

Every cold email should contain:
1. **Observation/trigger point** — why you're reaching out NOW
2. **Recency** — a specific event or news item
3. **Value proposition** — make/save money or time (be specific)
4. **Social proof** — quantifiable results from similar companies
5. **Call-to-action** — soft (low friction) beats hard (demanding)

## Framework 1: Observation + Solution + Social Proof + CTA

```
[Personalized observation about their situation]

[Solution statement — what you do and for whom]

[Social proof — specific result for a similar company]

[Soft CTA — question or low-friction ask]
```

Example:
"Mary, noticed you have over 50 open positions on your job portal. We help tech scale-ups reduce new employee churn from 30% to 10% or less. With typical mis-hire costs around $30,000 per employee, this means going from 15 mis-hires to 5, resulting in $300,000 saved. Worth a quick chat?"

## Framework 2: Trigger + Problem + Solution + Calculation + CTA

```
[Trigger: reason for outreach with numbers]
[Quick pitch: qualified impact explanation]
[Calculation: back-of-napkin math showing ROI]
[CTA: request meeting interest]
```

## Framework 3: Pain Point + KPI Template

```
Common problem we see is [X] which leads to [Y outcome].
Does that resonate?
```

Use when you know the industry well and can name the exact pain.

## Framework 4: Statistical Hook + Question + Problem + Value + CTA

```
[Surprising stat or industry insight]
[Curiosity-piquing question]
[Problem you solve]
[Value delivered]
[Soft CTA]
```

## Framework 5: Trigger + Social Proof + CTA

```
[Specific trigger: hiring, funding, growth, tech change]
[One-line case study: "already done so for [Company X]"]
[Soft CTA]
```

Best for signal-based outreach where you have a strong reason to reach out.

## Framework 6: Third-Party Resource Template

```
[Prospect's name], given you're [relevant activity], I thought you'd find [trusted resource] interesting — [why they should care].

[Optional soft ask]
```

Example: "George, given you're ramping reps, I thought you'd find Outreach's blog interesting about scaling to $3.2B without canned templates."

## Framework 7: Role-Based Curiosity

```
{{First Name}}, as a {{role}} leader, curious how {{specific responsibility they likely struggle with}}.
```

Example: "Armand, as a Sales leader, curious how your reps prioritize which accounts to reach out to?"

## The HOT Copy Framework (5-Step)

1. **Problem** — State the specific problem you've identified ("Your website is slow," "Your podcast clips are edited poorly")
2. **Observation** — Something non-obvious about them ("You have a TikTok account but no TikTok shop," "You're not using email automations")
3. **Connection** — Any genuine connection or common ground ("I also love [X]," "That [industry event] was incredible")
4. **Value** — Deliver something concrete upfront (email optimization tactics, a quick video re-edit, traffic analysis projections)
5. **Introduction** — Only THEN introduce yourself: "I'm [X] from [Y]. I've done [Z]. I think I can help."

Close with a direct, specific question — NOT a vague CTA.

## Follow-Up Sequence Structure

- **Email 1** (initial): Best offer, strongest angle
- **Email 2** (3 days): Same thread, lead magnet + social proof, different angle
- **Email 3** (14 days): New subject line, softer CTA ("Would [colleague] be better to discuss this?")
- **Re-reach**: 3 months later if no response

Stop after 3 emails. Additional follow-ups cause reply rates to DROP and increase spam complaints.

"80% of positive replies come in the first email."

## What to Avoid

- Generic language: "optimize," "streamline," "save time," "save money" — too vague
- Company-first messaging (lead with THEIR problem, not your solution)
- Big brand name drops that aren't relevant to the prospect (causes skepticism)
- ROI metrics that seem too good to be true
- Cheesy icebreakers and forced humor
- "Just checking in" / "Just following up" / "Just circling back"
- Excessive formality ("Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this email finds you well")
- Overly polished, corporate language

## Specificity = Credibility

Don't say: "We reduce shipping costs."
Do say: "Hi John — We're seeing that many e-commerce companies in the pet space doing at least $5k/month in revenue are overpaying for shipping by 10-15%."

The more specific your details, the more credible and trustworthy your message becomes.
