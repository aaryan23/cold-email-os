## How to Use These Sequences

These are battle-tested 3-touch sequences covering three distinct angles:
1. **Professional Growth** — Company success + team development
2. **Career Accelerator** — New role + personal advancement
3. **Vision Builder** — C-level storytelling + future-state painting

Each message takes a different angle while maintaining narrative consistency.
Keep tone conversational, layer in new personalization in each follow-up, use low-friction CTAs.

## Sequence 1: The Professional Growth Template

**Target**: Established companies with notable clients, sales leaders

### Email 1
```
Subject: [Company] x [Competitor]

[Name] — saw on your website you've won some awesome accounts (like [Client 1] and [Client 2]).
Mind me sharing how you can attract similar [industry] firms?
```

### Email 2
```
[Name] — also noticed on LinkedIn you've got some heavy hitters on the team ([Colleague 1] and [Colleague 2]) — no wonder you were able to land the likes of [Client 1] and [Client 2].

You've probably got everything dialed in, but as [role] leaders, it's hard to keep up with all the new tools popping up.

Want me to share a quick list of the [relevant tools/strategies] we think will dominate [their focus area] in 2025? Might be useful for you and the other veterans at [Company].
```

### Email 3
```
[Name] — looks like this might not be a priority right now, totally get it.

Before I close the loop, figured I'd try one last angle.

Saw that [Company] is hiring for a few [role] positions. Curious — how are you equipping new [roles] to ramp fast and hit [goal]?

If you're open to it, I can send over a quick breakdown of how teams like [Similar Company] are using [solution] to shorten ramp time and boost pipeline.

If I don't hear back, I'll assume you're all good.
```

## Sequence 2: The Career Accelerator Template

**Target**: Professionals 0-6 months into a new role, ambitious sales reps

### Email 1
```
Subject: [X] months in — getting into the groove yet?

Wassup [Name]!

[X] months into the role — getting into the [function] groove yet?

Re your onboard, I've got something right up your alley.

Something that'll propel you to the most formidable [role] in not just [Company], but the entire [industry] space.
```

### Email 2
```
Guaranteed to blow the socks off your [their boss name/title, [Name]].
```

### Email 3
```
Getting intrusive here… but I'm tentatively assuming you're earning somewhere in the region of [salary estimate] (been in your shoes).

I'm here to teach you the hard skills to double that — just like [social proof].

No fluffy [function] theory. But cool sh*t. [Specific tools/techniques] to target your key buyers in the most powerful, personalized way — just like this outreach sequence.

The skills the future demands, [Name]!
```

## Sequence 3: The Vision Builder Template

**Target**: C-level executives, data/analytics companies, Series A-B companies

### Email 1
```
Subject: Picture this, [Name]

[Name] — picture this.

You're in your quarterly board meeting with [key stakeholder].

Someone asks about last Q's [key metric].

Instead of the usual "let me pull that data", you casually whip open a dashboard.

Jaws drop.

[Colleague 1], your [title], sees [insight type] they never knew existed.
[Colleague 2], your [title], spots golden opportunities hiding in plain sight.

Every insight is there — crystal clear, automated, beautiful.

And you have those board-ready metrics you've been dreaming about…
```

### Email 2
```
(Okay, a little carried away with the jaw-dropping part.)

But as you approach [milestone — Series B, growth phase, new market], you want to get your [function] house in order.

[What you do and how] is exactly what [we/I] do — and have been doing for [X] years.
```

### Email 3
```
Final note from me, [Name]:

We recently worked with [Case Study Company] — not [their exact vertical] but still [relevant similarity] — to [specific outcome] in just [timeframe].

Worth sharing their case study?
```

## Sequence Principles

- **Narrative consistency**: Each email should feel like it's from the same conversation, building on previous touches
- **New angle per email**: Don't repeat the same pitch — bring a new observation, different hook, or fresh resource
- **Escalating vulnerability**: Move from professional in Email 1 → more personal/direct in Email 3
- **Final email signals finality**: "Final note," "Last message," "If I don't hear back" — creates urgency without desperation
- **Max 3 emails** before pausing (4th email reduces reply rates by 20%, 5th by another 55%)
