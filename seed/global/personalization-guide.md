## Why Personalization Matters

Generic outreach that could apply to thousands of people gets ignored. Great personalization makes the prospect think: "There's no way this email was written for anyone else but me."

Key principle: Personalization must feel natural and relevant while demonstrating genuine research. Quality personalization should always tie back to value.

## Personalized Email Templates

### Template 1: Org Chart Gap

```
Hi [Name], just checked out your org chart — noticed you're lacking SDRs (LinkedIn data, grain of salt).
I'm tentatively assuming, therefore, you're juggling prospecting, running demos, and closing deals all on your own — might be tough to manage as you scale?

I work with early-stage companies like [Similar Company] to deliver the impact of 5 SDRs for the cost of 1.
In fact, we recently helped [Relevant Company] increase monthly meetings by 34% without adding headcount.
Mind if I share more info?
```

**Personalization**: Clay enrichment to identify if company has SDRs + GPT to infer job responsibilities from title.

### Template 2: Identify Core Expertise + Persona

```
Hi [Name],

Got something for you.

I gather [Company] specializes in [core expertise] (always a win when [positive outcome], nice work).

This morning, my Co-Founder and I came up with a wacky idea to help you attract more [Target Persona] looking to [Key Motivation].

Mind if I shoot it over to you?

P.S. We've seen similar strategies work wonders in other industries, but yet to really hit the [vertical] space — might help you get ahead of [Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2].
```

**Personalization**: Company summary for core expertise + target persona identification + competitor research.

### Template 3: Notable Client Reference

```
[Name] — saw on your website you've won some awesome accounts (like [Client 1] and [Client 2]). Mind me sharing how you can attract similar [industry] firms?
```

**Personalization**: Review company website for case studies, logos, testimonials.

## Best Practices

1. Verify enriched data before using — LinkedIn headcount is often inaccurate
2. Combine multiple personalization points for deeper relevance
3. Keep personalization relevant to your offer — don't personalize randomly
4. Use recent and timely information (prefer last 90 days)
5. Front-load personalization in your messages
6. Always tie personalization to value — "I noticed X, which is why I thought Y would help you"
7. Keep tone professional but conversational
8. Quality > quantity — one great personalization beats five generic ones

When you lack common ground: "We worked with [X] — they're a little different to [industry] — but still just a young, vibrant company like [target company]."
